### The Zero-Trust Immune System for Hospital Networks

**An autonomous, document-grounded AI agent that reads medical device manuals, hunts vulnerabilities, and programs live firewalls — without ever touching the physical device.**

## The Problem

Hospitals run thousands of connected medical devices — patient monitors, infusion pumps, imaging machines — each with its own firmware, its own network requirements, and its own known vulnerabilities. A single compromised IntelliVue monitor is a lateral-movement launchpad into the entire clinical network.

Today, securing these devices is **manual, slow, and error-prone**: a human reads a 200-page PDF manual, cross-references CVE databases, and hand-writes firewall rules. It doesn't scale, and it doesn't happen in real time.

## The Solution

**PANACEA is an autonomous security agent that does the whole job itself.** Drop in a device manual and it will:

1. **Read** the manufacturer PDF and extract every network requirement
2. **Plan** its investigation, then **retrieve** grounding evidence — more than once, when it needs to
3. **Cross-check** known CVEs for that exact device and firmware version
4. **Decide** a zero-trust firewall policy, resolving conflicts between what the manual requires and what the CVEs forbid
5. **Enforce** it live on a Vultr Cloud Firewall — real ALLOW/DENY rules on a real VPC
6. **Report** an auditable incident memo with a per-rule citation trail and an explainable confidence score

> **The pitch:** an auto-generated, compliance-safe immune system that operates entirely at the network layer — no agents installed, no device firmware touched, fully HIPAA-aligned with zero data egress.

## What Makes PANACEA Win

| Capability | Why it matters | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **True multi-step agent** | Plans → retrieves → checks CVEs → re-retrieves on conflict → decides → enforces. Not a one-shot RAG call. | `agent/orchestrator.py` |
| **Per-rule citation trail** | Every ALLOW/DENY in the memo is grounded in a cited manual passage or CVE record. No fabrication. | `agent/prompts.py` |
| **Explainable confidence** | Score derived from reasoning depth and evidence coverage — e.g. `82% — 3/4 rules grounded in cited evidence`. | `orchestrator.py` |
| **Policy drift detection** | Re-scan a device and PANACEA flags what changed since last time — a continuous immune system, not a one-shot scan. | `orchestrator.py` |
| **Multi-device orchestration** | Secure an entire fleet concurrently in one call. | `POST /agent/multi-run` |
| **Full audit log** | Every autonomous decision is written to an append-only JSONL trail — every action is auditable. | `services/audit_log.py` |
| **Live firewall enforcement** | Real Vultr Cloud Firewall rules, live-tested against a real target VM. Safe-by-default mock mode. | `services/vultr_firewall.py` |
| **Compliance justification API** | Nemotron turns any decision into plain English a compliance officer can read in an audit. | `POST /agent/explain` |

### The 7-Step Loop

| # | Step | What happens |
|---|------|--------------|
| 1 | **Ingest** | PDF uploaded to Vultr Object Storage |
| 2 | **Extract** | Serverless Inference parses ports/protocols/firmware → Contract A, streamed live |
| 3 | **Cross-Check** | Agent grounds a CVE lookup in a dedicated Vultr Vector Store collection |
| 4 | **Decide & Score** | Agent generates the zero-trust policy + explainable confidence → Contract B |
| 5 | **Store** | Manual chunks + policy pushed to Vultr Vector Store as the canonical record |
| 6 | **Enforce** | Policy applied to a live Vultr Cloud Firewall |
| 7 | **Report** | Cited incident memo generated and sealed as tamper-evident evidence |

## Tech Stack

- **Backend Orchestration** — FastAPI (Python 3.12), async agentic tool-calling loop
- **AI Compute** — Vultr Serverless Inference (NVIDIA Nemotron) — *strictly no OpenAI, for the HIPAA-compliant zero-egress pitch*
- **Memory / RAG** — Vultr Vector Store — *strictly no local ChromaDB/Qdrant*
- **Enforcement** — Vultr Cloud Firewall APIs + Vultr VPCs
- **Evidence & Events** — Vultr Object Storage (Object Lock) + Vultr Managed Kafka
- **Identity** — Vultr IAM / OIDC operator identity in strict mode
- **Frontend** — Next.js, React, WebSockets (real-time agent reasoning stream)

> **The "no substitutions" rule:** every intelligent component runs on Vultr-native services. That is the whole pitch — a security product you could actually ship to a hospital on sovereign infrastructure.

## Quickstart

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env      # fill in your Vultr keys
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Health check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/healthz
# {"status":"ok","service":"panacea-backend"}
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # point NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL at your backend
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:3000
```

### Run the agent

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agent/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"raw_pdf_text": "", "vpc_id": "vpc-medical-01"}'
```

An empty `raw_pdf_text` falls back to a built-in Philips IntelliVue demo excerpt, so the pipeline always has something to reason over.

## The Agent in Action

A real run streams something like this to the Command Center:

```
[STEP 2] Extracting network requirements from device manual...
[STEP 2 DONE] Device: Philips_IntelliVue | Firmware: B.01 | Ports: [24105, 24005]
[STEP 5] Chunking manual and storing Contract A in Vultr Vector Store...
[MEMORY] Retrieving authoritative evidence through Vultr RAG...

PLAN:
  1. Confirm port 24105 is required by the manual, not just mentioned
  2. Check CVEs for IntelliVue B.01
  3. Resolve any manual-vs-CVE conflict before deciding

[TOOL CALL -> retrieve_document({'query': 'UDP 24105 Data Export', ...})]
[TOOL CALL -> check_cve({'device_model': 'Philips_IntelliVue', ...})]
[TOOL CALL -> apply_firewall_rule({...})]

[CONFIDENCE] 88% — moderate deliberation; 2/2 rules grounded in cited evidence
[STEP 7] Generating incident memo with citation trail...
[EVIDENCE SEALED] Lease lease-a1b2c3; object evidence/2026/...
```
